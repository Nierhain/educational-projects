# Fomantic-UI
Fomantic-UI is a community continuation of Semantic-UI, that was started as the development of Semantic-UI came to a halt. It not only brings all deependencies to modern days it also adds some features aswell. I wanted to explore Semantic-UI a bit to get a feel for different CSS Frameworks and as the installer of it is not updated (or atleast i got some errors while installing) I switched to Fomantic-UI. Nevertheless, let's dive into it.
