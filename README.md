# Educational projects
This is the repository where I keep all my stuff I did to learn a tool, framework, language or other stuff for my coding career and adventures. Feel free to check them out and learn, contribute or use some of the code. After all this is meant to be a place not only for myself but for other people to get the gripes of different coding topics.
